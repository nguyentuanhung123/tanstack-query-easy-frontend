# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## State Management in React App
- Types of state

- I categorize States in React App into 2 types:

        |    Server State	                 |   Client State                                         |
What	|    Data from API fetching	         |   Purely data from client side                         |
Examples|	 product list, details from API  |   active state of checkbox, selected theme, language   |
Lib	    |    tanstack-query	                 |   useState for local, zustand for global               |

## NOTES
- For client state, please use local state until you need global state.
- The more global states in your app, the more complex your app gets.

### Setup QueryClientProvider

- Create queryClient once ONLY, as it hold the query cache data.
- QueryClient has default options, check it out here

- src/index.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// create once with default options
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

### Add devtools for easier debugging
- Install devtools package - more details

- npm i @tanstack/react-query-devtools

- src/index.jsx

```jsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
      <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Core concepts

# |	Name              |	Desc                                                                            |
1 |	Queries           | Promise based to fetch data from API, binding to an unique key                  |
2 |	Mutations         |	Used to modify query data (create/update/delete) or perform server side-effects |
3 |	Query Invalidation|	Smart invalidate queries and potentially trigger refetch                        |

- More details: https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/quick-start

## NOTES
- Data fetching is not handled by React Query, it will be handled by axios/fetch/... lib instead
- React Query will manage the data return from a Promise (specifically APIs in our case)
- Fetching data can come from HTTP method GET or POST
